It was created during 2015 as a final project at the University of Granada and the aim of this project is to serve as a physical rehab system that will be usefull for medics and physical trainers. It's based on different technologies such as Augmented Reality, Kinect SDK v2, Qt SDK 5 (OpenSource), OpenGL, ... and it's wroten in C++.

ARehab is at an early stage of development, therefore, the binaries are not distributed. Only the source code and resources needed are distributed. The user interface is localized in Spanish, but i18n will be a feature that is in my TODOs list.
