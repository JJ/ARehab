# ARehab
ARehab is a freeware software for physical rehab, aided by Augmented Reality technologies and user tracking systems, such as Microsoft Kinect v2.

The ARehab project was created during 2015 as a final project at the University of Granada. 

The aim of this project is to serve as a physical rehab system that will be usefull for medics and physical trainers. It's based on different technologies such as Augmented Reality, Kinect SDK v2, Qt SDK 5 (OpenSource), OpenGL, ... and it's wrote in C++.

ARehab is at an early stage of development, therefore still an executable is not distributed. Only the source code.

The following screenshots shows the interface design that has beware of a great design and having the user experience and the usability as a priority.

ARehab is at an early stage of development, therefore, the binaries are not distributed. Only the source code and resources needed are distributed by now.

The user interface is in Spanish for now, but this will be a feature that is in my TODOs list.
